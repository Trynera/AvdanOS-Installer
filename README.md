# AvdanOS-Installer
A "Downloader and USB Flasher" of the AvdanOS ISO File (It doesn't actually do that lmao)

really unfinished and not worth checking out unless you want to finish it.
It's based on Tauri and has no code in the backend and is almost finished in the frontend (I think).
Good Luck cuz you'll need it.

You can execute it by running: "npm run tauri dev"
